### Elevator Pitch ###
In today's world, there is so much media being produced that it can be hard to keep up! Big corporations are pumping out TV shows and movies 
at an astonishing rate, with most of them being cheap cash grabs or bloated spin-offs. However, in today's world time is valuable. Who has the 
time to sort through everything ever made to try and find something new to watch? My startup, Simply Cinema, aims to help you sort 
through the sea of mediocrity with the help of your friends. Whenever you or your friend watches something new you can add its data to the 
database, which is then instantly shared with everyone. You can give the show or movie a description, rating, and leave comments. You can find 
new recommended shows to watch, or warn your friends about a movie that's not worth their time. The power is in your hands with Simply Cinema!
